2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment for the backend
```bash
python3 -m venv backend/venv
# On Linux/macOS
source backend/venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (PowerShell)
.\backend\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On Windows (cmd)
.\backend\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
3. Install dependencies
Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

```bash
env

GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your_google_maps_api_key>
```

5. Google Calendar Setup
Download credentials.json from Google Cloud Console and place it in the backend/ directory.
Run backend/main.py once to generate token.json for authentication:
```Bash

python backend/main.py
```
6. Run Backend
Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```Bash

uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
7. Run Frontend (Streamlit)

```Bash
 streamlit run frontend/app.py
```
